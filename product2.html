                <li>Actual products may vary in shape or design as per the availability.</li>

                <li>The delivery cannot be redirected to any other address.</li>

            <h3>Care Instructions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Place your plant in a location where it receives at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight each day.</li>
                <li>Ajwain plants prefer warm temperatures between 70-85°F (21-29°C). Protect them from cold drafts and frost, as they are sensitive to low temperatures.</li>
                <li>Ensure the soil pH is slightly acidic to neutral (around 6.5-7.0).</li>
                <li>Reduce or eliminate fertilizer during the dormant season (fall and winter).li>
                <li>Prune your Ajwain plant regularly to encourage bushier growth and maintain its shape. Harvesting leaves for culinary use can also serve as a form of pruning.</li>
                <li>For cuttings, take 3-4 inch (7-10 cm) stem cuttings, remove the lower leaves, and plant them in a well-draining mix. Keep them warm and moist until they root.</li>
                <li>Treat any infestations promptly with insecticidal soap or neem oil.</li>
                <li>With proper care and attention to its sunlight, water, and soil needs, your Ajwain plant can thrive and provide fresh, aromatic leaves for your culinary creations.</li>
